# sDake-Mimi
This repository houses all my research regarding mimi as well as tutorials, data, and figures relating to said research.

Here are my instructions for running the [tutorials](instructions.ipynb)

The respective julia files for each mimi tutorial are titled after themselves.
They do not have test cases though I may add what their results should be to the instructions file.

## LearnCiam
This folder contains most of the research.

## figs
Contains important figures for the research. Main reason being that one can find them without needing to run their respective notebooks or use them to crosscheck their results.

## data analysis
This contains my notebooks for analyzing, selecting, and manipulating data for future ciam runs using raw data that has not being normalized.
